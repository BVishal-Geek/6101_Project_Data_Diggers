Here's the correct ordered list based on your original intentions:

**Question 1: How do the hazard classifications of asteroids relate to their proximity to Earth in terms of Perihelion and Aphelion distances?**
   - Test: Chi-Square Test for Independence or Logistic Regression.
   - Reason: To understand how 'Hazardous' classifications are related to 'Perihelion' and 'Aphelion' distances.

**Question 2: Does the impact of Perihelion Distance vary with the diameter and velocity of the asteroids? (ANOVA Test)**
   - Test: ANOVA Test.
   - Reason: To analyze the interaction between 'Perihelion Distance,' asteroid diameter, and velocity in relation to hazard classification.

**Question 3: Can we measure the impact of eccentricity and Perihelion Distance on asteroid hazard classification using statistical tests?**
- Test: Chi-Square Test for Independence or Logistic Regression.  
- Reason: To assess the impact of 'Eccentricity' and 'Perihelion Distance' on the binary 'Hazardous' classification.

So, based on your original intent, you can indeed use the Chi-Square test for independence or logistic regression to analyze the impact of 'Eccentricity' and 'Perihelion Distance' on the binary 'Hazardous' classification for Question 

**Question 4: Is there any significant difference in the orbit uncertainty, Mean Motion, and inclination with a change in Perihelion Distance? (Chi-Square Test)**
   - Test: Chi-Square Test or other suitable test.
   - Reason: To explore the relationship between orbital parameters (orbit uncertainty, Mean Motion, inclination) and Perihelion Distance. 

**Question 5: What are the most influential features in predicting whether an asteroid is hazardous?**
   - No specific test mentioned, but you can use feature selection techniques, such as feature importance from machine learning models.
   - Reason: To determine which features have the most influence on predicting asteroid hazard classification.
