# Project Name: EVALUATING ASTEROID CHARACTERISTICS AND PREDICTING HAZARD LEVELS USING NASA'S ASTEROID CLASSIFICATION DATASET

### Project Description: 
Our research project centers on NASA's Asteroid Classification dataset, a comprehensive repository of information on near-Earth objects (NEOs). 
This project aims to analyze this dataset to gain insights into the properties and classifications of asteroids, particularly those categorized as potentially hazardous or non-hazardous. 
Our primary objectives include understanding the physical and orbital characteristics of NEOs, identifying the most critical variables impacting asteroid classification.

### Dataset: 
Our dataset is available as Nasa Asteroids Classification: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shrutimehta/nasa-asteroids-classification at Kaggle. All the data is from the (http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/). This API is maintained by Space Rocks Team: David Greenfield, Arezu Sarvestani, Jason English, and Peter Baunach. The dataset consists of 4687 data instances (rows) and 40 features (columns).
